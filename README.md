# Map_Coordinates
These java exercises either read values from or write values into a .CSV file. The values written in the .CSV file represent the X- and Y-Coordinates of geographical points (also referred to as a Waypoint) on a map. Multiple Waypoint objects will make up a Route object, which is graphically represented in Processing IDE.
