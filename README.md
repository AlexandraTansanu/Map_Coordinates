# Map_Coordinates
This java exercises either reads values from or writes values into a .CSV file. These values are a numerical representation of the X- and Y-Coordinates of geographical points (also referred to as a Waypoint) on a map. Multiple Waypoint objects will make up a Route object, which is graphically represented in Processing IDE.
